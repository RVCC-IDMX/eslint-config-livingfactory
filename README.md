## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

The "semi" rule in ESLint is certainly important. It makes it so semicolons will either be used always or never in code. While JavaScript does not require semi-colons, using semi-colons only sometimes can cause unforseen issue within code. This is where the "semi" rule comes in. If a semicolon is inserted after a return statement that is not a literal, the semi-colon will cause an unreachable error. Using "semi" will enforce a standard for using semicolons which will protect your code.

You can read more about it here.
